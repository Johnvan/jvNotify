# jvNotify
This program is writen for myself and helps me remember things like all the events I use such as Loga and the program reminds me of the Day and Time these events occur. 
There is a Notes page on top of the events page which holds things like Password changes, things I would like to talk about etc. This page also holds events that have expired as a record so is available should the event come on again.
The events also triggers the phone Notification System and can be set in the Add/Note Description Entry page. 
The Notes Description Entry page is where both Notes and Events are setup, If only a Note is entered without a Date, it becomes a Note only;
Placing a Date/Time makes the Note an Event which has other settings such as: OnGoing (Daily, Weekly, etc) so it is on going;
The Date or Day setting is wether the on going is an on going Day (Mon, Tue, etc) or is always on the same Date (30Dec23) will set the next date to 30Dec24;
the Warn enters how many days you want the Popup to warn you when the Event will occur;
the Notify Min is the Notification trigger minutes setting;
the Notify Hours is the Notification trigger hours setting; and
the Save and Delete do just that.
I am about to make changes to the Appointment page that changes the heading background colour depending how far the appointment is.
